# Advent of Code 2024

## Description

As in the past two years, adecc Scholar returns to Advent of Code on stream, 
and this repository contains the program along with my solutions to the challenges. 
It’s always a great opportunity to test one’s skills, learn new things, and, of course, 
stay true to adecc Scholar’s mission: leveraging modern C++ and professional 
techniques to solve problems.

Some might wonder what Advent of Code is, why so many tackle these challenges in 
streams, and what it means for you. Advent of Code is a digital advent calendar 
for programming enthusiasts that lights up brains every December! 
From December 1st to 25th, a new mind-bending puzzle is unveiled daily, unfolding 
like an interactive Christmas tale. The tasks are woven into a story where you’re 
called upon to help Santa’s elves prepare for Christmas.

The challenges range from simple puzzles to complex algorithms, requiring creativity, 
logic, and coding skills. It doesn’t matter which programming language or even 
command-line magic you use – you decide how to solve the riddles. Here, the focus 
is on C++. It’s not just about finding solutions but enjoying the process of tackling 
challenges with a festive flair.

Ready to embark on a winter coding journey?

Once again, I approach the tasks as part of a "complete" application rather than 
writing quick, standalone programs. My goal is to demonstrate modern techniques for the 
C++ language, showcase development methodologies for business applications, explain 
decision-making processes, and create general functions that can be reused for 
future tasks.

Naturally, the focus remains on modern C++, especially **C++20 and C++23**.

Even though I draw inspiration from existing code, such as the "adecc Scholar" library, 
all helper methods are reimplemented and explained from scratch here. This allows us 
to treat December as a fresh start, and no prior knowledge of my previous streams is required.

## Word Problems

### The Importance of Word Problems for Analytical Thinking and Their Relevance to Computer Science

Word problems in mathematics are much more than just exercises in computation. They present real or 
fictional scenarios where the key is to think analytically, structure information, and find solutions. 
This process develops essential skills:

1. **Problem Recognition:** Identifying relevant information and filtering out irrelevant details requires 
precise reading and analytical thinking.

2. **Application of Knowledge:** Word problems connect abstract mathematical concepts with practical 
applications, teaching us how to apply learned skills to new situations.

3. **Learning New Skills:** Often, word problems contain unexpected challenges that encourage creative 
solutions or the acquisition of new methods.

### Word Problems for training of computer scientists

These skills are especially critical for training computer scientists, as they form the core of 
problem-solving in computer science:

1. **Problem Recognition and Definition:** Computer scientists must analyze problems carefully, 
break them into smaller sub-problems, and identify the key questions. Like with word problems, 
this is the first step in finding effective solutions.

2. **Data Structures:** Just as important numbers, variables, or relationships are identified in 
a mathematical task, computer scientists search for appropriate data structures to model relevant 
information.

3. **Algorithmic Thinking:** A computer scientist develops algorithms to solve problems efficiently—similar 
to finding a calculation strategy in a word problem. This requires the ability to think analytically and 
systematically.

In both computer science and mathematics, the challenge lies in working with limited information and numerous 
possible solution paths to select the best approach. Solving word problems trains precisely this ability, 
making them an indispensable foundation for success in computer science and other analytical disciplines.
