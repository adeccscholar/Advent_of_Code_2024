# Advent of Code 2024

## Description

As in the past two years, adecc Scholar returns to Advent of Code on stream, 
and this repository contains the program along with my solutions to the challenges. 
It’s always a great opportunity to test one’s skills, learn new things, and, of course, 
stay true to adecc Scholar’s mission: leveraging modern C++ and professional 
techniques to solve problems.

Some might wonder what Advent of Code is, why so many tackle these challenges in 
streams, and what it means for you. Advent of Code is a digital advent calendar 
for programming enthusiasts that lights up brains every December! 
From December 1st to 25th, a new mind-bending puzzle is unveiled daily, unfolding 
like an interactive Christmas tale. The tasks are woven into a story where you’re 
called upon to help Santa’s elves prepare for Christmas.

The challenges range from simple puzzles to complex algorithms, requiring creativity, 
logic, and coding skills. It doesn’t matter which programming language or even 
command-line magic you use – you decide how to solve the riddles. Here, the focus 
is on C++. It’s not just about finding solutions but enjoying the process of tackling 
challenges with a festive flair.

Ready to embark on a winter coding journey?

Once again, I approach the tasks as part of a "complete" application rather than 
writing quick, standalone programs. My goal is to demonstrate modern techniques for the 
C++ language, showcase development methodologies for business applications, explain 
decision-making processes, and create general functions that can be reused for 
future tasks.

Naturally, the focus remains on modern C++, especially **C++20 and C++23**.

Even though I draw inspiration from existing code, such as the "adecc Scholar" library, 
all helper methods are reimplemented and explained from scratch here. This allows us 
to treat December as a fresh start, and no prior knowledge of my previous streams is required.
